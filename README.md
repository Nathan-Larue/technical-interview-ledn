# LEDN Technical Interview

## Stack Used

### Node.js
I've been using Node at my previous company (Bliinx) and in most of my personnal project, so it made sense for me to use it.

### React
I decided to work with _React_, even though I never had the chance to try it out. There were two reasons behind my decision: First, I would allow me to learn and understand _React_, which would also tell me if it would be a stack I would like to work with; Second, since _React_ is a technology used at _Ledn_, it would allow my evaluators to use their expertise to question my coding decisions.

## Design Decision
I decided to go with a design rather similar to the one your app is using (vertical header to the left, content to the right), but with a dark theme instead. For the content itself, I decided to follow the [a table dark theme wireframe](https://dribbble.com/shots/6714447/attachments/6714447-Table-Dark-theme?mode=media) from [Anastasia Buksa](https://dribbble.com/buksa).
